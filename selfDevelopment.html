				<p>Hello, Everyone! My name is Pasha, I am 26 years old and I would like to tell you a story about how I was able to overcome my fears and discovered new sides of myself and new future perspectives. Especially when all the odds are against us and it seem that the whole world is out of their mind. And no matter what we should always stay positive and move only forward. I was able to change my life and I love what I’m doing now.</p>

				<p>I found out what it means to work hard at a very young age. When I was 14 I started working with my friend at his PC gaming club where I acquired skills of computer systems and network administration. However I was not working there for very long as I entered an agricultural college. At that time I wasn't sure if it was the right decision but it was already too late to change the strategy. During my studies I met a guy who offered me a job as a salesman and showed me how to earn good money without putting in much effort. I was very happy because I was good at it. I was sure that if you are able to sell you will be successful and independent. That's how my sales career has began. A little bit later I was hired as a salesman by one of the biggest electronic trading companies of Ukraine. Guess what I had to work with? Yeap, with computers and laptops which I knew very little about. To not lose my job I had to learn so much in 1 week as I never had before. It was so hard that I even was studying in my dreams. But this hard work made me understand that without skills I wouldn’t be able to do much in life. So I have completely changed my attitude towards learning. I’ve put a lot of effort and in only one and a half years I became a manager of Sales Department. And after another 6 months, I became the deputy executive officer of the store. After that I was working for a few other companies, the last of which was Coca-Cola. I was working with a great team of young successful specialists where I, myself, have been recognised as the best employee of the month few times in a row. It seemed that everything was going fine, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was in the wrong place. I wasn’t as thrilled after finishing a business meeting or closing a successful deal anymore. After every passing day I had less and less will to go to work. My attitude towards my job has changed. My life was so repetitive that another "Groundhog Day" movie could be made after it.</p>

				<p>Time was passing... Our country as well as the whole of Europe were fighting the financial crisis. At this point of my life, a period which forced me to look at things differently has began. And what happened next still doesn’t make any sense for me. Disagreements started to grow stronger among people in my country. Unfortunately, one by one we started to forget about kindness and you could feel intense aggression from those around. As a result it has triggered a war. People started losing their jobs, refugees were escaping to Kiev, the capital, to find some help and support. A lot of them had lost theirs homes.  People were standing in lines to get some financial help to survive. The crimes were growing in numbers every day and it became unsafe to even go out for a walk. Consistent fear that battle could reach your home troubled all the time. This war didn't make any sense but took a lot of young lives. People were taken from theirs workplaces and universities and sent to the military front. It was terrible. As time went on, little by little everyone started to move away from this. They were going on about their lives but at the same time everybody did understand that there was a war in the country and we should be ready for anything. Same as everyone I was thinking about what would happen next. Once again I realized that if I want a good and safe future for me and my family I would need to work very hard once again.</p>

				<p>Ukrainian people are very diligent and ability to work hard runs through our DNA.  But in given situation a lot of people started to give up and apart from blaming authorities and complaining they did nothing to improve their lives. I was thinking a lot about it and started to realise that it wasn't the world we lived in that was bad, it was lack of will to change ourselves.  Therefore I’ve finally decided that it wouldn’t happen to me and started to look for a way out. Considering  what I could do next I was given an idea to become a software developer. The offer was very tempting but it seemed very unreal. Firstly I could not imagine myself as a developer who would sit whole day long and type some code in. Secondly, to become a successful developer I had to have good English skills but my level was zero! O_o And as I was already 25 I couldn't allow myself to spend 5 years studying at a university so my study had to be very intensive without any weekends and brakes. No personal life... I wasn't sure that I could do it, but I was inspired by a lot of interesting stories from my friends and slowly I started believe that it can be possible. But I had to start from scratch. So I decided to leave the country that nothing would stay in my way. The thought about it was giving me chills because I have never been abroad before.  With support from my family we started preparing for new challenges and discoveries.</p>

				<p>The decision was final. I was scared… No, I was frightened to my bones but I knew what I had to do. There was no place for second thoughts, I believed that it was the right move. All I needed was a “Fresh Start”.

					<p>9 months ago I made a hard decision to move to another country and take an uneasy path to change my career. I understood that it was time to make a new turn in my life. To prove to myself that possibilities of a person are limitless. The challenge has been accepted and I’ve taken first steps towards my goals.</p>

					<p>As I wrote earlier, thoughts about immigration were scaring me a lot. But there was no way back and I and my wife, thinking about the possibilities, decided to go to Thailand. When we arrived my brother and his wife were waiting for us already there. He meant to become my mentor in software development and his wife to be our English teacher. As soon as they met us, they attacked us with English and when I tried to talk to them in our native language they pretended that didn't understand me. I had to use gestures or search dictionaries to explain what I needed. So It was very hard from the very first day of our journey. The second test was even harder. I had to quit smoking and drinking habits and switch to gym and healthy diet. We started to go to the gym three times a week and one month later it was already five times a week. It helped us to get necessary strength for even harder trainings. Honestly, It was very uneasy for me for the first few months and at one point I wanted to give up. But then with family support I was able to overcome myself and even fall in love with sports. And after half a year I was doing 15 pull-ups when it was only one at the beginning. Now training has become a significant part of my life. It is one of the greatest victories I've achieved and I am very proud of it. Visiting new country, new culture and meeting a lot of interesting people opened up the world to me from a very different perspective. Especially when you don’t have any limitations in communication it gives you the ability to gain new experience from people with different ways of thinking. And it enriches the vision of the world and creates potential opportunities in your life.</p>

					<p>Another essential part of my transformation was learning. To make the learning process of IT technologies faster we focused on English first. After a week of adaptation we have begun intensive work. At the beginning it was like a joke because my English level was only few basic words. My speech was more like a set of words which I couldn’t make sentences of.  But later when I caught up on grammar a little, everything became clearer. I was still sometimes making up weird sentences which puzzled people I was talking to. It was fun to watch their faces :). So every time when I was going to a store or a market or even to the Thailand Immigration office I was realising more and more that without English I could not achieve anything. The process of studying was put on the conveyor, on the working day basis. I started to write my study plan down into my notebook but me, running around with a sheet of paper, was rather amusing to my brother and he showed me digital means of organizing my work. He showed me very cool task manager Trello and also a timer app Pomello. They helped me plan my time more effectively and were suggesting what I should work on and for how long, and when I should take breaks. It helped me to dive into the process 100%. These programs were so simple but for me they were like a discovery of the century. It was so convenient to make some changes to your plan and monitor the progress and the time spent. So to be most effective we've made a timetable where I had to study English 10 hours a day. And free time meant to watch movies or play video games in English as well, which didn’t seem like rest at all.  For the first month I was studying grammar, learning new words and practicing pronunciation. It was like an infinite loop. I was sitting at home and studying more than 100 words per day but next day I could not remember most of them.  At such pace It was difficult to keep everything in your head. A little bit later we have added reading and writing to my study and I was attempting to speak as well. It increased intensity of studying even more because nobody cancelled learning words and grammar. Every evening we were sitting with my brother on the balcony and I had to tell him some news or stories. The main goal was to speak as much as possible. At the end of the day my brain was sore like muscles after gym. We have done a lot of work and three months later I’ve started to see some results. For the first time in three months of living in another country, I was feeling comfortable because I could talk to people and freely express my thoughts. It was one more victory that helped me believe in myself. I ceased all doubts at that time!</p>

					<p>Continuing to study English I’ve started to understand that I need to move on to the next level: learning how to program. I’ve created another plan based on tested and working scheme. Now when I was  able to understand English better I was able to watch tutorials from online schools like "CodeSchool", "Pluralsight" and "TeamTreeHouse" where I began learning HTML. In 5 days I was able to build my first visit card webpage. It didn’t have any styles and looked very simple, but I was so impressed that this small piece of text with my photo that was displayed in the browser was created with my own hands. I was very inspired by the first successes so I continued to study with even greater interest. I have mastered HTML quite quickly and I gradually moved on to CSS. Here I had some troubles because I had to practice a lot in order to learn what every element did and even after that some unpredictable things would still occur. These road bumps were driving me crazy. Simple tasks seemed impossible to do because the styles didn't do what I meant them to do. Anyhow, the hard work and patience delivered necessary result. In a few months I've made my first website. It was a little bit rough but later I was able to fix all defects. And one more thing that I learned was to be more tolerant and patient to the work I was doing. It became clear to me that with hot temper I wouldn’t be able to do anything and only when I calmed myself down I was able to resolve the issues. So, when I learned how to build websites and style them I started to study programming language JavaScript. When I have tried programming for the first time I was very surprised at how many cool things you could do. Believe me, for a sales manager it was mind blowing.  It was very interesting to see how easily you could communicate with computers just knowing some simple commands. It’s like when you were asking your friend to help you with something and he did it with pleasure if it didn't interfere with his believes.^_^ I'm enjoying every minute of what I’m doing now and I continue to improve every day.</p>

					<p>I can say with most certainty that everything what I’ve done so far and what I will do is the most interesting experience in my life. When I overcome another challenge and learn from it, it’s like a new flower is blooming on my tree of life. I know this is exactly what I wanted. I'm moving forward and I’m unstoppable. :) <a href="#up" id="next">Read next essay...</a></p>

					<p>Looking back I’m really glad that I wasn’t lazy to push myself out of my comfort zone. That I was able to walk this path and set the beginning of a new career in web development. The fight is still on and when I finish one challenge I gradually move to another. I’ve finally found what I want to do and this is the most important victory in life of every person. Because when you don’t know what to do and who you really are that’s when you are most vulnerable. You lose your interest in life, follow the current and give up any attempts to chase your dreams.</p>

					<p>This story tells about my aspiration to find new sides and talents in myself. I started my journey nine months ago and there is no end to it. But I am quite confident that by joining a talented development team I would be able to contribute to more difficult projects. It would be an excellent opportunity for me to work with professionals and speed up my development. Though I am still a junior but my aspiration to grow will help me to learn necessary technologies and techniques very fast to work effectively for the common goal.</p>

					<p>Experience in development of my portfolio website and other attached to it websites, gives me confidence that I can manage required tasks. I am not afraid of difficult tasks and I am ready for new challenges. Self-organization helps me to use my time effectively and my focus and persistence helps me to finish what I start. My experience in sales and management will help me to organize myself, quickly join a project and figure out necessary business processes to implement a particular product.Many years of experience in working with people made me stress resistant and prepared to work under pressure and peacefully resolve conflict situations. I respect other people's values and visions, communicable, honest and joyful so hope to become a good member of new team. All these qualities are my precious partners in life.</p>

					<p>I would like to work for a company where one of the main values is high quality of  products they are working on. Among people who have a lot of creative ideas and innovations. With people who are working with desire to progress and improve new technologies. Those people who have mutual understanding and treat each other like a family. A team for me is like a single organism where people are cells which cooperate to achieve their goals. I would dedicate myself to a company like this.</p>

					<p>Now I am focused on studying of front-end web development and to become a professional in this area is my first goal. But I am not going to stop there. I am interested in different areas of IT. It is very fascinating to learn new technologies which are popular in modern world. Also to create new products which are making our life simpler and more interesting. In the future, I would like to develop programs for mobile devices. Humanity is developing with incredible speed in this area and I think it is the future. The world of Information Technologies is absolutely limitless and very interesting, that’s why I will do my best to become a better developer.</p>

					<p>I wish everyone to find your calling and be confident in yourself! Remember, while you are fighting for your dreams you will get the desired. But if you stop, your dreams will always be just that - dreams. Your destiny is in your hands.</p>
